This is an unfinished project even though form.class.php DOES work.
It needs a lot of cleanup and modifications made to make it adaptable to other types
of form fields, such as select menus, radio groups, checkboxes etc.

The code is poorly commented at this time since it was written quickly as a fix for
something.
The goal is to impliment PHP's DOMDocument into it and have it generate the complete
form syntax and support additional field types, which is why domtesting.php was
included as a reference document since I did some testing with it.

At the time of creating this project, I do not have a need for it at the moment,
so I am making it as a future project to re-visit at a later date.

If you would like to improve/build on this code, please feel free to do so.

I only ask to give me credit in the code and license it under something like MIT or
another loose license so others can use it and build on it themselves.

Thanks.
